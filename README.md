# Milestone1 Project Tic-Tac-Toe

Welcome to the Milestone1 project! This is a website that showcases the work I have done in my first milestone project as part of the Full Stack Software Development course from ThriveDX.

## Description

This website is a single-page application based off the game Tic-Tac-Toe. The main objective of this project is to demonstrate my ability to create a responsive and interactive website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

The website has several features, including:

-A game board: A 3x3 grid
-Player: Typically, X's and O's are used as player.
-Turn tracking: The game must keep track of whose turn it is, so that each player can take their turn.
-Valid move checking: The game should be able to determine if a player's move is valid (if the space they've selected is empty).
-Win conditions: The game should have a way to determine if a player has won the game (if they've placed three of their pieces in a row).
-Tie conditions: The game should also have a way to determine if the game has ended in a tie (if all spaces on the board are filled and no player has won).
-Reset function: The game should allow players to reset the board and start a new game.
-Display: The game should display the game board and keep track of player scores.
-Sound effects: Adding sound effects to the game can make it more engaging for the players.
